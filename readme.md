These katas assume you are using a computer running Windows. They can be adapted for other operating systems, but the instructions won't be exactly correct.

You will need Windows Terminal installed. Powershell should be set as the default profile.

You will need a web browser. Windows comes with a browser named Edge. The instructions in these katas assume you will be using Edge, but most other browsers should work too. The instructions may need to be modified slightly.
